#  Style for { and }
#  C style means that { is at the end of the line
#  and } is on a line by itself.  For example,
#  if (myTest) {
#    //  This is c style
#  }
#

#  The following parameter is the minimum number of blank lines

#  It is also the number of lines before and after

#  Note that this is a minimum.  If your code already

#  Default Javadoc comments

#  The following items are used by the mechanism that
#  automatically inserts javadoc comments.  Other than
#  author (which I recommend that you change), these
#  values are probably sufficient.  However, if you
#  want to make it easer to search your files to find
#  where the values are missing, you can change these
#  to something more unique.
